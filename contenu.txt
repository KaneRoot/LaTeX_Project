GPGPU
General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU, also referred to as GPGP and less often GP²) is the technique of using a GPU, which typically handles computation only for computer graphics, to perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the CPU. It is made possible by the addition of programmable stages and higher precision arithmetic to the rendering pipelines, which allows software developers to use stream processing on non-graphics data.

	The head office of NVIDIA is based in Santa Clara, Calif., NVIDIA was founded in 1993, by Jen-Hsun Huang, who had previously served at LSI Logic and AMD, and Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, who came from Sun Microsystems. The company went public in 1999 and is listed on NASDAQ, where its shares trade under the symbol NVDA. It has some 5,700 employees in more than 20 countries.


	Health Care Benefits
	NVIDIA offers a good coverage to its employees for all the medical stuff.
	NVIDIA helps also by paying the majority of the cost of the coverage for the dependents of the employees.

	Pre-tax Premiums
	A Pre-Tax Premium plan is a benefit that allows employees to pay their portion of your group sponsored insurance premium with pre-tax dollars. By using pre-tax dollars, employees reduce their income taxes and ultimately save money.

	401(k) Retirement Plan
	A 401(k) is a type of retirement savings account.
	The major attraction of these plans is that the contributions are taken from pre-tax salary, and the funds grow tax-free until withdrawn.

	Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)
	A flexible spending account is an account into which amounts are deposited to be used as payment for future eligible health care expenses.


	So working at NVIDIA seems to be really good but in fact if you ask some employees the reality is different...


	I'm going to present the products
	Nvidia sells many different ranges of video-cards so as to meet the needs of as many people as possible.
	There are some video cards for a basic use, some for workstations and for gaming.


	First graphics card : NV1 for games console Saturn of Sega

	The RIVA 128 and RIVA 128ZX (DirectX 5)
	The RIVA TNT, RIVA TNT2 (directX 6), it's a success which makes NVIDIA the market leader.
	
	The GeForce : 13 types of GeForce (GeForce 8 integrete CUDA technology)

	The Quadro

	The Tesla


	Whenever Nvidia launches a new product, AMD launches a similar product in the following weeks.	

SLI
How Does SLI Technology Work?
Using proprietary software algorithms and dedicated scalability logic in each NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU), NVIDIA SLI technology delivers up to twice the performance (with 2 cards) and 2.8X the performance (with 3 cards) compared to a single graphics solution.

How Do I Get SLI?
To run SLI, a PC needs to be equipped with an SLI-Certified Motherboard and 2or 3 SLI-Certified GeForce GPUs. We also recommend using an SLI-Certified power supply and chassis for maximum stability.

CUDA Architecture
CUDA is a revolutionary parallel computing architecture. As an enabling hardware and software technology, CUDA makes it possible to use the many computing cores in a graphics processor to perform general-purpose mathematical calculations, achieving dramatic speedups in computing performance.

OpenCL
OpenCL™ (Open Computing Language) is a new heterogeneous computing environment that runs on the CUDA architecture. It will allow developers to harness the massive parallel computing power of NVIDIA GPUs to create compelling computing applications.

PhysX
NVIDIA® PhysX™ is a powerful physics engine enabling real-time physics in leading edge PC and console games. PhysX software is widely adopted by over 150 games, is used by more than 10,000 developers of all types and is supported on Sony Playstation 3, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii and PC. 



LIBVDPAU
VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) is an open source library (libvdpau) and API originally designed by NVIDIA for its GeForce 8 series and later GPU hardware,[2][3] targeted at the X Window System on Unix-based operating systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris).[4][5][6] This VDPAU API allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.
The libvdpau standalone VDPAU library is distributed by NVIDIA independently of their proprietary Linux graphics driver.

Concurrence

AMD accused NVIDIA to cheat with PhysX
AMD maintained indeed that NVIDIA had modified the PhysX API in order not to have the best performance with multiple processors in the CPU , and so to give an advantage to the NVIDIA GPU.


ATI brought out the crossfire one year after SLI, it's approximately the same thing. In the same way, AMD brought out the Hybrid crossfire in 2008, just after NVIDIA



NVIDIA announced it has signed a new six-year cross-licensing agreement with Intel. For the future use of NVIDIA's technology, Intel will pay NVIDIA an aggregate of $1.5 billion in licensing fees payable in five annual installments, beginning Jan. 18, 2011.
